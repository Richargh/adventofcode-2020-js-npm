# Advent of Code 2020

The code for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
Probably won't win any beauty contest but I can play around with js again, which is fun.

## Usage

* `npm test`

## Starting a new project

First, make sure you have the right node version installed. 
Or, even better, use nvm (Node Version Manager for [MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

    How to start any new Node.js project:

    $ npx license mit > LICENSE  // downloads MIT license
    $ npx gitignore node  // create node gitignore
    $ npx covgen YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS  // generate the Contributor Covenant
    $ npm init -y  // create package.json with defaults

    You're ready to start coding.

After `npm init` you should open your `package.json` and add the line `"private": true`. 
That way you can't  accidentally upload your project to npm.
